Please, as this code resuses the logging information from the previous part, you can just run the tests as "npm run silent_test" to get a clear response in terminal.

Thanks for undertand. Please, be patient with me: I'm learning :)

As for 4.10, the test "can create a new blog" I would just check if it returned a 201 instead of count the number of blogs.

As for the last exercise, I did not update the update blog to only update them if you are the user because it was not specified...

the final .env file contains the next parameters like this:
MONGODB_URI=
PORT=
SECRET=
